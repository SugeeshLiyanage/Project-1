Vibe Journal - Communicating Mood through Music

Vibe Journal is a journaling tool designed to motivate people to become more emotionally self-aware. It does this by allowing the user to write and interact with a tool that reads their journal and recommends music based on that journal entry and mood.  Overtime it will enable it’s users to communicate their moods through music while acting as an alternative therapy tool.

Multiple studies suggest that keeping a diary or maintaining a routine of expressive writing can: 
Lower stress levels 
Boost memory
Manage intrusive thoughts that can lead to a decrease in productivity. 

Vibe Journal uses a semantics tool to analyze your journal. It then recommends music based on how you’re feeling. To studying sentiment simply means you study the meaning of words.
Having a semantics tool is useful when:
 Working with press releases
  Advertising 
  Understanding customer satisfaction
In general, semantics tools are becoming more popular in the PR and Social community fields.
